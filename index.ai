before executing any code changing commands, make sure the code you analyzed to perform the change is indexed in this file.
Use a consise structured indexing system, that would allow the minimal lookup needed in this file in order to read the code that is required to perform a task.

Any task definition generated should include, as its first step, reading and following the instructions in this index.ai file to ensure compliance with the project's standards and guidelines.

Always finalize any task by verifying TypeScript using 'npx tsc --noEmit' to ensure there are no type errors before considering the task complete.
